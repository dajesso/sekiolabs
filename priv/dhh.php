water</h3> Begin with your Tylenol 1 tablets. Generally, each 200 count bottle contains 
1.6g of codeine phosphate, or 1.2g of codeine freebase (relative MW: 397.4/299.4, or 
phosphate to freebase conversion factor about 0.753). Grind them finely with a coffee 
grinder or blender, then (for every bottle you are extracting) add approx. 500mL of 
boiling water to a 2L flask, a large stir bar, and then while stirring, add the crushed 
pills. You should get a slurry of pill binders, APAP, etc. Let it stir 5-10 minutes, 
and <b>while the mixture is still hot</b>, set up a Buchner filter with some Celite, 
and filter the solution. This step is necessary to remove the bulk of the insoluble 
binders. Then, once filtered completely, you can rinse the filter cake with a little 
extra boiling water to ensure nothing is left behind. Now, take your solution and chill 
it to just above freezing, causing the acetaminophen to precipitate in a sort of cold 
water extraction. Give it a good stir to ensure that all the APAP precipitates, and 
while cold, filter on the large-diameter Buchner (you will need much less Celite for 
this filtration and can even omit it if you have some pressing need to recover pure 
APAP.) Once this process is done, your solution contains a roughly 2:1 ratio of caffeine 
to codeine phosphate in water (with some acetaminophen).</p> <p><h3>Step 2. Selective 
extraction of codeine from caffeine</h3> There are two ways to go about the extraction 
of codeine as freebase from this mixture. The old way I did it was by first extracting 
the caffeine away with dichloromethane, then addition of strong base, then extraction 
of the codeine freebase with more DCM. However, I found that using diethyl ether will 
selectively extract <i>just the codeine</i> from a caffeine/codeine freebase mix. So, 
we can skip the whole double-extraction nonsense and simply add enough base (sodium or 
potassium hydroxide is good, but carbonate will also work) to convert the codeine to 
freebase, and extract the aqueous <i>multiple times with small volumes of ether</i> - 
for a 1500ml water phase, you will probably need anywhere from 6 to 15 extractions with 
100-200mL ether each time. The ether is dried with magnesium sulfate and evaporated 
down in a tared roundbottom flask until 1.2-1.3g of material has been extracted (it 
will be a mixture of about 85-90% codeine freebase and ~10% caffeine as well as ~3% 
acetaminophen, as I remember). At this point (ideally after analysis of your material) 
you can discard the water solution. Now you have crude freebase codeine. </p> 
<p><h3>Step 3. Conversion of codeine to dihydrocodeine with catalytic transfer 
hydrogenation</h3> Dissolve the codeine from before in a small amount of methyl 
alcohol. Next, add a small amount of your hydrogenation catalyst to a small Erlenmeyer, 
along with a stirbar. Gently pour the methanol solution of codeine down the side of the 
flask, and then add about 5-7 equivs of ammonium formate to the mix, (molar wt 63g/mol, 
5eq is about 1g ammonium formate per gram of codeine, 7eq works out to 1.4g ammonium 
formate per gram codeine, any excess is removed later) as well as some additional 
methanol (totalling maybe 100mL). This is stirred at r.t. for somewhere between 30min 
and 60min. I always used MS to follow the reaction, as codeine and dihydrocodeine share 
very similar RTs on a DB-5 column, but have a difference of 2 AMU. (I believe, but have 
not tested, that seeing if a sample decolourizes a small amount of iodine in ether or 
DCM (addition across the double bond, not present in the dihydro- compound). Workup 
consists of first filtering the catalyst from the solution (you can use a small bed of 
Celite, some Celite mixed with Pd/C will not harm the reaction and may in fact reduce 
fire risk) followed by removing as much of the methanol as possible with a rotovap, 
partitioning the residue between alkaline sodium carbonate solution and DCM, taking the 
DCM layer, rinsing with water and then brine, and drying it over MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 
filtering, and rotary evaporation, to yield dihydrocodeine as freebase in practically 
quantitative yield.</p> <p><h3>Step 4. Demethylation and acetylation</h3> For this I 
had always used a Parr hydrogenator pressure flask, but in theory a regular RBF with 
condenser should also work. Following an adaptation of the procedure in the reference 
listed, first a calculation is made to determine how many moles of DHC you begin with 
(MW of freebase dihydrocodeine is 301). For the reaction to work, you will need a 
minimum 2 equivalents of HBr to react: one equivalent is used to form the HBr salt, and 
one equivalent reacts with the methyl ether to form methyl bromide and the free phenol. 
An additional 0.5 equiv is added for good measure, meaning you need 2.5 mols HBr per 
mol DHC. Now, it is <i>vitally important to note that this must be a solution of 
hydrogen bromide in acetic acid with no water present</i> - you will <i>not</i> get the 
same results by mixing aqueous hydrobromic acid with acetic acid! (For preparation
notes, please check note number 2 below). The commercial solution I worked with was
approx. 33% HBr by weight and a density of 1.354g/mL, meaning about 44.7% w/v 
(or 5.52 mmol/mL, or 7.48 mmol/g), which, at 8.3 mmol HBr per gram of DHC needed 
(1 <small>g</small> DHC / 301 <small>g/mol</small> * 2.5 <small>mol HBr/DHC</small>)
conveniently works out to a nice round number of <b>1.5 mL of 33% HBr in acetic 
per gram of DHC freebase</b>. A little extra will not hurt.<br/> Add your dihydrocodeine
to some glacial acetic acid, between 2-3g acetic per gram DHC, and then add the
hydrobromic acid in acetic acid solution, and either cap the pressure vessel or 
put a condenser on top of your flask, and place it on a water bath set at between 90 
and 100C. (Acetic acid's boiling point is about 110C so you don't have to worry too 
much about pressure buildup. Let it sit and cook (I did the reaction without any 
stirring as the metal water bath wouldn't allow a magnetic stirbar to work, though in 
retrospect the hotplate setting would have worked as well. Regardless, the reaction 
worked fine. From memory I seem to recall it took about 2-3 hours to "cook". The end 
product is actually a mixture of products: in the original paper their desired target 
was dihydromorphine, but this demethylation reaction conveniently instead produces 
acetate esters of the demethylated product, that is to say, it produces <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacetyldihydromorphine">dihydroheroin</a> and its 
primary active metabolite in humans, 6-acetoxy-dihydromorphine in approximately a 30:70 
ratio, as the hydrogen bromide salts. Instead of hydrolysing or freebasing these potent 
compounds, we isolate them untouched by simply removing the excess acids via 
coevaporation with methanol. After the reaction has completed, the flask is cooled down 
(in a stream of cool running water) <i>especially if using a pressure flask - you don't 
want to gas yourself upon opening it.</i> Next, add a copious volume of methanol and 
pour the whole mixture into a RBF and pop it on the rotovap. As the solvent removal 
slows down, remove the flask and add another portion of methanol, then continue 
evaporation. You are doing two things to help removing the solvent and extra HBr - 
first, the methanol will react with acetic acid (esp. in the presence of a strong acid 
like HBr) in a <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer%E2%80%93Speier_esterification">Fischer 
esterification</a>, producing more volatile <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_acetate">methyl acetate</a> and water. 
Second, a similar reaction occurs where methanol and HBr react to form <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromomethane">bromomethane</a> and water, in an 
acid catalysed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN2_reaction">SN<sub>2</sub> 
reaction</a>, again to make easier to handle, more volatile products. After multiple 
evaporations, and raising the rotovap water bath temperature to approx. 60C or so, 
should result in a tan to pinkish residue in the flask.<br /> Finally, take a tared 
large glass petri dish or pie pan. Add a small amount of methanol to the flask with 
your product in it to rinse it off the flask walls as a suspension. Pour it into the 
tared dish, making sure to get it all in there. Then, with a hotplate on gentle heat, 
move the dish around to encourage the methanol to evaporate, and once it becomes dry 
and crusty, switch to a metal spatula or the like, and scrape the material around and 
break up any chunks to allow solvent to be removed entirely. If you want to be 
absolutely sure your solvent is removed, once you have a free-flowing dry powder, add 
it to a dry RBF and put it on the rotovap with a hot bath temp, or put it in a vacuum 
oven if you have one. (I never found those steps necessary though). As long as it is 
dried to a constant weight, that was good enough for me. <br /> Given the relative MWs 
of the products (410.27<small>g/mol</small> for 6-acetyl-dihydromorphine HBr, and 
452.34<small>g/mol</small> for dihydroheroin HBr) compared to the SM 
(301<small>g/mol</small> for DHC) means that 1 gram of DHC freebase will produce 
somewhere between 1.36g and 1.5g of product - using the earlier figure of approx. 30:70 
ratio between the two, it works out to 1.4g product per gram of DHC. So, for our 4.8g 
of codeine earlier, we get approx. <b>6.75g</b> of our mixture, consisting of approx. 
2.0g dihydroheroin HBr and 4.75g 6-acetoxy-dihydromorphine HBr. No further purification 
is really needed, a small amount of caffeine is usually the only impurity present.</p>

 <h3>Notes</h3>
 <list>
  <li>[1]: you can actually bypass the first several steps if you have a source of
dihydrocodeine tablets, or even do a much more simplified extraction with DCM instead of
ether in the case of pills that contain only codeine phosphate and acetaminophen and no
caffeine (Canadian Tylenol 1s seem to be unique in this aspect)</li>
  <li>[2]: hydrogen bromide in acetic acid can be prepared by generation of anhydrous HBr
gas and bubbling it into glacial acetic acid. The literature method is by reacting a 
bromide salt like e.g. sodium or potassium bromide with phosphoric acid (n.b. commercial
phosphoric acid is only 85% and the remaining 15% water should be removed by distillation
first for best results) and the gas delivered through a drying tube packed with calcium
sulphate but the reaction is slow and yields are low. A better method is described in
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2705670A/en">US2705670A</a> involving the
production of anhydrous hydrogen bromide with certain concentrations of water and sulphuric
acid. The HBr gas is bubbled into a measured amount of glacial acetic acid and as the
reaction progresses the density is measured occasionally and the gas addition stopped once
the density hits around 1.35-1.36<small>g/mL</small>. Store in a sealed, amber glass bottle,
in the fridge.</li>
