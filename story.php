<h3>Who is this sekio person anyway?</h3>
<p>I'm sekio. I was born in 1992, and I am <?php echo $years; ?> years old. 
I grew up, and reside in, the Vancouver area of British Columbia, Canada. 
From a young age I was taught to be a critical thinker and to be curious. My 
parents were both well-educated: my mother has a degree in molecular biology 
and my father had a degree in organic chemistry. In addition I was using a 
computer at a very young age. I have two younger brothers too, who are two
years younger than me, and are fraternal twins.</p>

<p>After high school, I attempted (and failed) to go to technical 
school for a programming degree, but found the material beneath me. Luckily, 
I ended up working for my father as an organic chemist and acquired quite the 
skillset. I did many multistep syntheses on up to the kilogram scale, worked 
with air-sensitive and toxic reagents, operated both a GC/FID and a GC/MS, and 
ordered reagents from chemical companies. In addition, I was responsible for 
developing a new, optimized, synthesis of a compound we sold in large volume. 
In addition I did a large volume of research in pursuance of opimized methods. 
My career as a chemist lasted approximately 7 years.</p>

<p>In 2017, on March 31, I went to bed, thinking everything was fine, and 
tomorrow would be another day like anoy other. I awoke outside on the pavement, 
to two paramedics and a fireman saying "Oh look - he's awake." Overnight, there 
had been an electrical fault in the wall of my basement suite, and it caused 
my wooden desk to go up in flames (among other things), resulting in me being 
rendered unconcious by smoke inhalation. Due to the heat of the fire, the 
polyester pyjama pants that I was wearing ended up melting to the front of my 
legs, resulting in third degree burns all over the front of them.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I would live with my father, who had by then turned fully into 
a mental abuser - none of my other family members would talk to him. I was 
required to pay him rent to live in his house. Eventually he kicked me out, 
and I was left to live with my good friend (who unfortunately was an 
intravenous fentanyl/opioid user, and was dependent on them at the time), and 
(even better) his bitter, alcoholic mother. After she drcided to move cross 
country, we were both rendered homeless, and I spent some time on the streets 
of Burnaby as a result.</p>
<p>Thankfully, an organization named Progressive Housing eventually housed me
in a 3-storey modular housing building. Life was good, until one day in summer 
2020 - I was in a unit on the third floor, and was leaning out of my hip-height 
window, watching some commotion on the street. I remember a sudden flash of 
pain and losing my breath, and the next thing I know I'm laying on the dirt 
below the building, and paramedics are scraping me up, and... <i>I can't move
my legs?</i></p>
<p>It turns out after the fall not only did I break my spine at T4 (the fourth 
thoracic vertebra), I also broke a rib and deflated my <i>other</i> lung 
somewhat. I had a chest tube for some time, and spent about 6 months in rehab 
learning to use a wheelchair and the like. The end result of the injury is 
that I have no sensation or mobility below my pectoral muscles or my diaphragm. 
My arms, however, work perfectly fine, aside from occasional, tolerable nerve 
pain.</p>
<p>I have also, at some time, broken my right femur, and also fallen out of bed 
and knocked two teeth out. I still smile though!</p>
<p>My mental outlook on life is that I should be as positive, kind, generous, 
caring, accepting, respectful, and an educator. I think that people need more 
deep, authentic connections with others, as well as more face-to-face 
interactions. Part of this, in my opinion, stems from a fear of extroversion - 
today everyone is supposedly out to scam or harm you in real life, and all 
connections are made online, where it's even harder to judge intent. I try my 
best to always be the "real me" in my interactions, online or otherwise. But,
I also have a strong dislike for certain types of people: melodramatics, manic 
depressives, people who ruminate excessively, and people unwilling to accept 
advice at all, as a few examples. I try my best to be kind and respectful, but 
I also can be rude and mean to anyone who doesn't reciprocate.</p>
